          <p>A matter of great public concern over the past few years has been the incidence of police violence in the United States. This has led to the rise of Black Lives Matter
          and significant new reporting on the subject.</p>
          <p>Data on this subject is notoriously bad. However, some independent reporting efforts from major news outlets have created impressive databases in the last few years.</p>
          <p>The map below shows every death by police in 2015 and 2016. Each dot represents one death, and is color coded based on race, and darker or lighter depending on whether the victim was

              <p>The data used in this visualization is from The Guardian's project entitled <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database" target="_blank">"The Counted"</a>.
                It is an ongoing project that tracks deaths resulting from police violence in the US. Their project does a very good job of statistics on a state-wide basis, as well as some interesting statistics based on race.
                I thought a useful expansion of this would be to bring in the armed/unarmed element. Therefore, the interaction between race and whether the victim was armed seems important to analyze, as police misconduct is clearest when the victim was unarmed.</p>

            <p>This chart illustrates that there is in fact a disparity between how differently armed victims have differing outcomes depending on their race. Most shocking is the clear disparity between Blacks and Native
             Americans and other racial groups. While unarmed, they are more than twice as likely to be killed by police, and nearly twice as likely to be killed regardless.</p>
            <p>There are certainly arguments to be made regarding whether it is fair to measure these distinctions purely on a racial basis. It is very likely that there are factors such as share of violent crime committed,
            and socioeconomic factors beneath those. Nonetheless, the fact that there is twice the likelihood of an <b>unarmed</b> person of certain races to be killed over other races is something that is unlikely to be
            explained away by other factors.</p>

            and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries" target="_blank">further research by The Guardian</a>:</p>

                <li>England &amp; Wales have had <b>55</b> fatal police shootings in the last 24 years, while there were <b>59</b> fatal police shootings in the first 24 days of 2015.</li>

          <p>You may have asked yourself 'Why is this data coming from a British newspaper than the American government?' while reading through this. This is a very valid concern that has become a significant conversation in recent months.
              FBI director James Comey has said it is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fbi-director-calls-lack-of-data-on-police-shootings-ridiculous-embarrassing/2015/10/07/c0ebaf7a-6d16-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html?utm_term=.45751808e195" target="_blank">
            "ridiculous" and "embarrrassing"</a> that news publications such as the Guardian and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/" target="_blank">
            Washington Post</a> have more comprehensive data about fatal police encounters than the Federal government does.</p>
            <p>While there have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ferguson-michael-brown-measuring-police-killings/" target="_blank">efforts</a>
                to comprehensively track this sort of data, it still largely remains a mess. However, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-government-finally-has-a-realistic-estimate-of-killings-by-police/" target="_blank">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>
                has recently released a more comprehensive report, and the Justice Department recently <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-trump-enforce-the-tough-new-rules-on-reporting-police-killings/?ex_cid=538twitter" target="_blank">announced new rules</a>
                that require departments to produce quarterly reports detailing deaths in custody or during police encounters. Failure to comply with these rules would mean a reduction in federal funding.</p>
            <p>Despite this good news, the bad news is that this reporting may be threatened by a Trump presidency. It will be up to a Department of Justice most likely led by Jeff Sessions to actually enforce these new rules. This will be an important area to keep an eye on,
                and is a very important step in increasing police accountability and hopefully reducing police violence.</p>
